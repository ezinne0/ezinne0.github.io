Ezinne Okonkwo Personal Website

Project Description
This is a personal website, created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It has 3 separate pages that are all accessible through links on the site. I kept the user’s experience in mind, adding minor details that are not noticeable, but make all the difference. For example, when a user clicks a link that leads to a page with many other elements, the link takes them to that specific element rather than to the top of the page. I used JavaScript to add the functionality seen when links or text are hovered over. It also allowed me to add extra animations such as the typewriter effect. CSS holds the sit together with its plethora of styling capabilities. In the CSS file, there are styles assigned to tags, classes, and IDs; all for the sake of an aesthetically pleasing layout. A few issues I ran into was over-assigning classes and IDs. It is generally better to reuse them, in order to avoid the confusion and tedious task of filtering out unnecessary elements. Also, there is a flexbox, layout to enable smooth resizing. In the future, I hope to implement a light mode. This mode would also be more cartoony, with icons and such. My hope with that would be to appeal to younger audiences or people who prefer that type of appearance on a site.

Pages
The home page has a general overview of who I am. The passions page will tell you about my hobbies and favorite activities. The last page (can find through the passions page) is a gallery of all the projects I’ve worked on.
