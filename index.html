        <p class="intro">Hello my name is Ezinne and I'm an American-born Nigerian girl. I speak Igbo and English and have an older brother who I absolutely adore! I’m a junior in high school and passionate about computer science and racial advocacy:)

        <h2><a id = "whoAmI?"></a>Who Am I?</h2>
          <p>In my free time, I like to cook jollof rice, though eating plantain is just as fun. Staying connected to my culture is very important to me, so you might find me listening to afrobeats. Some of my favorite songs are <a href= "https://open.spotify.com/track/18t2ofQiViidZHxOBVjpD1?si=916b016273ff46d5" target="_blank">“Koroba” by Tiwa Savage</a> and <a href= "https://open.spotify.com/track/7HhxQyDHGrtwqaR3QmH30N?si=13b41dc2420e4018" target="_blank">“Berna” by Flavour</a>. I’m involved in the Black Student Union at school, where we celebrate all black identities and ethnic groups.

          <p>I love learning about and discussing the many way racism presents itself in everyday life. Before ninth grade, I didn’t have much self-concept about how my race affected my life. Upon reading So You Want to Talk About Race by Ijeoma Oluo I took an interest in observing microaggressions, beauty standards, colorism, the school-to-prison pipeline, and more. I’m committed to combatting these issues by immersing myself in a thorough understanding and encouraging others to have difficult conversations surrounding how these issues affect them, negatively or positively.

        <div><p>I don’t like cheese but in a very specific way. I like pizza, but not cheeseburgers and nachos. I love Cheez-Its and Goldfish, but the extra cheddar versions are a definite no.  Living in California my whole life, I have never seen snow. Yes, I’m still shocked.
