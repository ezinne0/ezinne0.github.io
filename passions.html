      <h3>CODE</h3>
        <p>I am most proficient in Java, though I have experience with Python and Swift. Additionally, 
          I want to learn more about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because I enjoy web development. In 2022, 
          I participated in two free summer programs: <a href= "https://www.kodewithklossy.com/programs" target="_blank">Kode With Klossy</a> and 
          <a href= "https://girlswhocode.com/" target="_blank">Girls Who Code</a> I developed an app 
            based on fashion aesthetics related to color theory. In Girls Who Code, I learned how to build dynamic and 
            vibrant websites using CSS and JavaScript. I totally recommend these programs to any female-identifying or 
            nonbinary high school students, they fueled my passion for computer science:D My favorite characteristic 
            about programming is that there are thousands of ways to write one program; it’s all subjective. Not being 
            restricted by rules (aside from efficiency suggestions) allows me to be creative. It excites me to code 
            when I know there's a wide learning net to catch me when I make a mistake. My culminating project at Kode With Klossy Camp was an app called <a href="crochet.html#beDazz">"Bedazzled"</a>.

          <h3>CROCHET</h3>
          <div class="projawards">
            <div class="crochetContainer" id="crochet">
              <p>
                Where do I even start? Crochet is my favorite outlet of expression, and it’s also quite cathartic when I need it. I mostly make clothes and accessories for myself, close friends, and family. Similar to computer science, crochet encourages one to try something new (in this case it’s stitches, not lines of code). Different stitches create certain textures, so there is a lot of freedom to see what works for the vibe you are going for. Fashion in general is a huge part of my identity, I love putting random (but not too random) pieces together until I have something special. In fact, this past winter, my friend and I wrapped up an independent crochet project entitled: “Credit Where It’s Due, A Tribute to the Contributions of Black People to the Fashion Industry”.

            <h3>SING</h3>
        
          <p>Someone once told me (or maybe I heard it in a movie, I don’t really remember) that singing is talking in pitch. Talking. In pitch. For me, my voice is an instrument. And since I don’t know how to play any other instruments, you bet I use this one for all its intents and purposes. There is nothing like hearing your voice bounce off the walls of a stairwell.

        <h3>READ</h3>
        
          <p>Reading is what launched my imagination, not cartoons or video games, and for that I am so grateful. With books, I am forced to create an image in my mind, so lively but unique to me. For example, when I read the Harry Potter series, I was surprised at how different my imaginations of the characters were from the movie’s depictions.  Additionally, as a form of education, books are the best way I retain information. There’s something about a talented author and a good plot (or lack of one if it’s strictly educational) that keeps me hooked Find me on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/161816790" target="_blank">GoodReads</a>!
