    <h2 class="subtitles background-color">Credit Where It's Due: A Tribute to the Contributions of Black People to the Fashion Industry</h2>
    <p class="intro">“Credit Where It’s Due” was a three-month-long project, created by a friend and me. For this project, we researched the impact and contributions of black models and designers to the fashion industry today. To represent our research, we then crocheted 23 pieces in total. Each piece was either a direct recreation or inspired by a movement the model/designers started or contributed significantly to. Our culminating presentation was a fashion show, where we had 15 models in our show Watch the our fashion show below :)

    <p class="intro">BeDazzled is an app I created in Swift at Kode With Klossy. The app merges the idea of color theory as it relates to aesthetics. It offers functionality similar to Pinterest, but more personalized. After taking a quiz that determines their aesthetic, users get outfit ideas based on their aesthetic in order to style their own clothes and step up their outfits.
